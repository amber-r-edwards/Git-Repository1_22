# **8.22**
**Darnton - "No Computer Can Hold the Past** [[8.22 - Darnton.pdf]] 
- written 1999 - outdated
- similar message to what you see today regarding privacy - caution, desire for controls, fears of dangerous misinformation
	- interesting especially with AI presence in student assignments 
	- continuation of "old guard" ways that still are important for historical research if you go past the one required course
- digitization putting the onus on the reader to do the work for context, weight, and belief - again was always there but now is just more crucial to learning how to do history

- Darnton - Professor at Princeton, ended up at Harvard as Director of University; specialized in French History and History of the Book
	- voice of reason during fear/chaos 
- the web as a vehicle for learning - not a "learning tool" 
- knowing where the archives are - knowing the right people, finding the right permissions - movement away from the gatekeeping of knowledge
- formatting and concerns with citations
- intentions of those digitizing content
	- dumping text without considering quality of sources
- using a fragment rather than the whole - overlooking the value of the knowledge of the crowd
	- cherry picking - JSTOR limited to which journals could afford to have their articles included
- making the use of the web a part of the historical study methods/practices - share knowledge, more volume online

# **9.19**
- Zotero - written when it was created - connection to the methodologies presented by Scrag and Turabian (RR3)

# **9.26**
**Chepesiuk - JSTOR and Electronic Archiving** [[9.26 - Chepesiuk.pdf]]
- cost as a barrier of entry - smaller amount of journals included may make it less lucrative for a library/institution to partake/justify the cost if only one school is served
	- humanities not always the most lucrative division within an institution
- connection with Milligan's discourse over how to best preserve digital sources - images of older texts rather than text-documents
	- similar question of including as much context as possible to maintain continuity

**Spinella - JSTOR and the Changing Digital Landscape** [[9.26 - Spinella.pdf]]
- use of digital methods - changing trends and becoming more commonplace
	- complication of increase in materials over time

**Turkel, Key, and Roberts - "A Method for Navigating the Infinite Archive"** [[9.26 - Turkel.pdf]]
- Follows a similar vein to our course in terms of engaging with different research tools and digital methods - though less focused on the professionalization that 8010 has taken
- agree with the Twitter sentiment and I think we wouldn't find as much engagement if we were to start now since the change to "X"

**Messer-Kruse - "How Google Scrambled the Academic Mind"** [[9.26 - Messer-Kruse.pdf]]
- Different issue but same solution - looking at how you *teach* in the digital age which will then inform how we study/how others learn

**Reidsma - "Masked by Trust: Bias in Library Discovery** [[9.26 - Reidsma.pdf]] 
- section about rape - highly consequential given my research interests
	- transition to "sexual violence" and the question of usage of sex/sexual intercourse
- moral overtones with topics relating to sex
- leading into the question of if we're able to maintain objectivity and neutrality in the digital age
# **10.24**
**Milligan - "Illusionary Order: Online Databases, Optical Character Recognition, and Canadian History, 1997-2010"** [[10.24 - Milligan.pdf]]
- In conversation with Historiography this week discussion of Carney's *Black Rice* and the critiques that bring into conversation the usage of databases without considering the sources included and what is lost in not being able to view the manuscripts. As helpful and innovative as historical databases and other digital scholarship are, Milligan argues we have to go further in our critical analysis of them to consider them as a container of a source worthy of scrutiny - which can only be achieved through a certain degree of digital literacy.
- When the technical process is understood, such as the OCR example, we can ask new questions: What happens for sources that are mis-recognized? What if the images are less clear? What happens when the software processes more of one source records than another and adapts a bias through model training?
	- Larger critique of accepting technology on its face rather than taking the time to understand the limitations - the level of authority given to digital sources rather than scrutinizing in the same way we would a traditional source.
	- Danger of being an "unwitting digital historian" and the ethical question of whether one can be a non-digital historian in an age where everyone uses digital tools - admittedly or not.
		- Particularly relevant given the amount of historians who grew up with or during the digital age.
- Emphasis on transparency of what was used to access a source, what data was included in a dataset, coding behind a project, etc. in order to avoid being an "unwitting digital historian" and to create a larger transition of historical pedagogy and methodology for upcoming researchers to continue improving upon with standardization.
	- Examples of Spatial History digital projects where datasets are made accessible for scrutiny and collaboration/use.

**Putnam - "The Transnational and the Text-Searchable"** [[10.24 - Putnam.pdf]]
- Transnationalist perspective of digitization and affectation of sources outside of borders and the traditional bounds of archival research - more cynical/pessimistic view than Milligan, expressing a more urgent fear of what could/is being destroyed by digitization and an ignorance of digital methods.
- Similar to same conversation of considering the flaws in database contributions/inclusion in the same way of archival collections - Carney's *Black Rice* and Historiography.
- Concern over the loss of contextual knowledge such as when you travel to a location or skim a larger text in search of a certain topic. Potential aspect of making connections between things without understanding their individual wholes.
- Makes a clear distinction between digitization and its affects from digital history which he sees as a pointed discipline that is actively engaging with and correcting the potential issues - in conversation with the larger question of "unwitting digital historian" and ones ability to actually separate from digitization (or to lie about it).

**Thompson - "Why don't archivists digitize everything?"** [[10.24 - Thompson.pdf]]
- Important distinction between the original record and the digitized record that cannot be considered identical - but often are in common thought because of the general acceptance of technology and authority given to what we see, in the same line of thought as Milligan in discussing acceptance of results from key word searches without scrutinizing the process/OCR behind it.
- Reflection of the inherent biases in archives at a different level than traditionally considered with the original curators of an archive - if you only have access to digitized records and the only records that are digitizes are those deemed worth or able to be digitized, what are you missing and are you going to do the work to find out? Both Milligan and Putnam engage in this discussion, but Putnam's focus on the ability to do Transnational history without crossing any physical borders presents a more pressing example of what harms could come from losing potential sources by not physically visiting the archives at all and considering digital archival work adequate/the same.

**Prescott/Hughes - "Why do we digitize? The Case for Slow Digitization"** [[10.24 - Prescott-Hughes.pdf]]
- Making the case for "slow digitization" as a way to contribute to digitial tools and digitization in conjunction with traditional sources - against the push back from historians and scholars more broadly who refuse to accept digital methods despite the effects they inevitabliy have on their work.
	- ICW Putnam's assertion that many use them in secret and make a large mistake in not being transparent in method - to which Milligan is certainly in support of and would argue that there is no way to separate betwen non digital and digital historians on a certain level
- Concern over lack of consensus in digitizing archives which could paradox the idea that digital archiving's chief goal is accessibility by reversing the uplifting of underrepresented voices within historical archives through privilgeing some sources to be digitized over others. Criteria for decisions could range from most often usage, funding received, etc.
- Specifically looking at manuscripts which present a unique set of circumstances - similar to one of the complications brought by Milligan's OCR example of what wouldn't be recognized in a given OCR - and the usage of digital projects to juxtapose versions of digital records in conjunction with physical copies for an expansion on the scholarship rather than a replacement.
