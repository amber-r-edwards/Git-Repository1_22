- **Elton - The Practice of History, "Research"** [[9.3 Elton.pdf]]
- History as a search for the truth - debate of if such truth exists
	- the past as dead and irrecoverable - unable to be known
	- there is only subjective opinion of the past, not truths
- ==Argues that these stances ignore the practical matters of historical research and the discipline's methodology - able to know the truth even if you don't know all of it==
- comparing with empirical scientific research - recreations/re-enactments
- finding significance in events does not affect the independent reality of the event - not creating history by those actions
- anti-positivist - historians never work with materials of the past raw, no way of knowing if the knowable is in its true state
- asking the first question and then becoming a "servant of the evidence"
- necessity of historiography to prevent duplication, cover more sources, and open new questions
	- unprovable/lack of methodology
- quality>quantity - orderly and controlled assessment of evidence
	- how and why
- history doesn't exist in a vacuum
- imagination and scholarship

- **Jenkins - Re-thinking History** [[9.3 Jenkins.pdf]]
- what is history? 
	- history in theory (most of reading)
		- series of discourses about the past that do not create the world but give it meaning - historiography shows us the different meanings one could take
		- the past has already happened and gone - history is what we (historians) make of the past
		- limitlessness of historical content - inability to "re-cover" the past no matter how verifiable sources are
		- ==argues that method as a road to truth is misleading because of the range of methods - history composed by epistemology, methodology, and ideology==
	- history in practice
		- hapless relativism - what is the point of doing history if it is all relative to the interpretation of the historian
		- ==deconstructing other people's history as the precondition of constructing your own== - necessity of historiography and the way out of relativism
	- history in definition
		- History is a ==shifting problematic discourse==, ostensibly about an aspect of the world, the past, that is produced by a group of present-minded workers (overwhelmingly in our culture salaried historians) who go about their work in mutually recognizable ways that are epistemologically, methodologically, ideologically and practically positioned and whose products, once in circulation, are subject to a series of uses and abuses that are logically infinite but which in actuality generally correspond to a range of power bases that exist at any given moment and which structure and distribute the meanings of histories along a dominant-marginal spectrum. 

- **Somekawa - Theorizing the Writing of History or, "I Can't Think Why It Should Be So Dull, for a Great Deal of It Must Be Invention"** [[9.3 Somekawa.pdf]]
- tension between metaphor and accuracy/interpretation and fact
- creating historical meaning rather than discovering/interpreting it
- ==argues that "historians consciously acknowledge the propagandistic nature of all historiographical work and, to increase the effectiveness of their propaganda, engage in the conscious consideration of audience" (154)==
	- embrace relativism but not nihilism
	- against the idea that historians mimic accurately the experiences of past lives
- "This core belief in the past as an untold story underlies the process whereby one historical interpretation displaces another one; since each historical interpretation claims to relate the truth about a segment of the past, it may compete with other interpretations for the same "space." In contrast, fictional narratives do not displace each other." (150)
	- creation of the truth and creation of space in time (8540) - postmodernism of it all - subjectivity
- E.P. Thompson - historian as a transmitter - dislike, taking narrative from those who lived it and pretending you aren't there when the historian inserts themselves by writing or "transmitting" the history
- radical historians
- using historical argumentation to undermine the validity of historical argumentation
	- "Interpretation does not begin after the facts are gathered; interpretation creates the evidence and the facts." (152)
		- question of what artifacts survive, what gets chosen for a collection, what doesnt, etc. in archives
- Partner - "Writing history is a political and creative process, consisting of piecing together a narrative from chosen fragments from the past." (153)
- imagining the past as a grid with a continually changing and shifting axis 
- ==goal to demystify historical writing to serve a radical political purpose and let the audience in on the thought that history is actually about the present - honesty==

- **Young - France and the Origins of the Second World War, "Ambivalence Revisited: History and Historians"** [[9.3 Young.pdf]]
- sources from '80s and 90s' to highlight "dynamic quality of history" and where scholarship has gone
	- French archives not open until mid-1970s 
- suggests that France in the 1930s is as mystifying as pre-modern era historical events which are widely considered out of grasp of understanding due to limitations of sources
- "the reader is going to get an interpretation of an interpretation. In that sense, it is an impressionistic copy, which is no more valuable than the original and certainly is not intended to be a substitute for it." (38)
- shift from guilt few to a defunct collective
	- Marc Bloch (1940) - prior to trials 
	- Jean Paul Sarte (1949) - middle of hearings
		- later after emerging from POW camp - declaration of society gone degenerate
- memoirs - exonerations of reputations
	- reflection of why we see so many works about individual expeirences in the wake of such a inhumane period (not French-specific) both in nonfiction and fiction 
- 1950s works - archives closed and private papers restricted - elitism of studies
	- American fascination
- 1970s -  second wind of inter-war France scholarship after documents became more widely available - addition of new and unexplored perspectives
	- Renouvin - focus on foreign policy with British military and economic support
	- Americans - Pitts and Keeton - self-deception and defeatist attitudes
- 1980s - common desire to expose as many corners of the interwar tableau as possible
- question of morality's place in historiography - starkley un-neutral terms that provote reactions and impressions
	- exposition and determinism - inevitability and human error/misjudgment/ignorance - made worse if vocabulary is morally-laced
	- ==necessity of ambivalence - portray rather than trying to resolve uncertainty and confusion within the historiography==
		- **for a topic that's historiography is so laced with questions of morality and human emotion - arguing that you have to accept what it is as uncertain and confused rather than trying to make any amendments or fixes**


- **Ghosh - Archive Stories: Facts, Fictions, and the Writing of History, "National Narratives and the Politics of Miscegenation"** [[9.3 Ghosh.pdf]]
- shaping of history by archival conditions beyond anyone's control
	- "national narratives and identities remain strong features in the production of histories, particularly in the ways that histories are fashioned from the spaces and conventions of national archives and libraries." (27)
- ==goal - expand definitions of kinds of knowledges archives produce - problematize the impersonal description of archives==
	- argues that ethnography of the archive should include accounts of interactions with those we encounter while researching - similar to how we analyze the authors of texts
- denial of native women being sexually active with european men - "marginalized the practice of interracial cohabitation as something that was 'not respectable' or, alternately, 'something Muslim women did." (29)
	- reflection of contemporary anxieties about sexual purity and racial purity as it relates to historical imagination
		- **similar to the creation and upholding of the white savior of white women's purity - *Birth of America***
- Briton response of having mixed-race lineage as "cosmopolitan"
	- diminishing the overall violence of colonial activity and promoting inaccurate image of a racially tolerant Britain
- reflection of how Britons and Indians imagine their post-colonial, national identity
- vernacular sources - maintenance of the 'disrespecable' figure on the periphery to maintain the social order/larger body politic
	- respectability as a concern for the colonizer and colonized - two sides of the same violent coin
- "My archive stories were informative to the project because they demonstrated the ways in which the ==people I encountered attempted to discipline me into writing a history that resonated for them==. [...] showed that they had radically differing visions of this shared past and even diverged as to what might be suitable material for a historical research project." (39-40)

- **Friedlander - Probing the Limits of Representation: Nazism and the 'Final Solution', "Introduction"**  [[9.3 Friedlander.pdf]]
- ==goal - deal with the event with a global approach and a general reflection on the problems of its historiography==
- 1989 - "History, Event, and Discourse" - debate between Hayden White and Carlos Ginzburg over the nature of historical truth
	- Ginzburg - The Cheese and the Worm
- "event at the limits"
	- difficulty in creating a "master narrative" because of the magnitude of the transgression
- historical relativism and aesthetic experimentation - need for truth and opaqueness of events
	- postmodernism - multiplicity of equally valid approaches that is seemingly not diligent enough for an event at the limits which has a crucial need to be remembered accurately 
- link between ethical and epistemological dimensions
- failure of historical depictions to live up to the horrors no matter the approach

# **9.17**
**Mikhail - *God's Shadow: Sultan Selim, His Ottoman Empire, and the Making of the Modern World*** [[9.17 Mikhail.pdf]]
**"Introduction"**
- Columbus as a Matamoros - ideological drive of waging Christianity's war over Islam/The Ottoman Empire as the reason Europeans went to America
	- Ottoman dominance in the Mediterranean - monopoly of trade routes and military power
- "By ignoring Islam we have thus failed to understand Columbus and his age fully, and indeed, correctly. [...] Muslims were integral to what is inevitably a shared history [...] the Ottoman Empire made our modern world" (3)
	- western centered historical tradition
	- Matamoros as a remnant symbol
- Selim - tripling of empire's territories, first to rule oven Muslim-majority population, first to hold sultan and caliph titles. first non-firstborn son and to depose a sitting sultan
- revisionist account - holistic view
	- "If we do not place Islam at the center of our grasp of world history, we will never understand why Moor-slayers are memorialized on the Texas-Mexico border or, more generally, why we have blindly, and repeatedly, narrated stories that miss major features of our shared past." (8)
**"Chapter 6: Columbus and Islam"**
- Columbus' life within the context of conflict and connections between Islam and Europe
	- Genoa proximity to the Crusades - mercantile port
- Marco Polo - imagination of Nestorian openness to conversion in fervor of Crusading
- Seven Cities of Cibola - belief of their existence in the Atlantic
- exposure to Islam/Muslim world and strength through merchant sailing
- exposure to Native Americans in Galway - belief in an Atlantic route to Asia
**"Chapter 7: Columbus's Crusade"**
- framing of his voyage as a Crusade itself - defined in religious terms
- West African non-Muslims interpreted as other and therefore Muslim - allowed to treat with force and violence and legally take to the New World as slaves 
	- taken by Columbus across to the Atlantic and allow to encompass Native Americans - filtering through crusade language
- Ferdinand and Isabella as resolute Moor-slayers
- Columbus' time as a mercenary soldier - conquering of Granada
	- voyage as an extension to gain on Ottoman victories over the Mediterranean, Europe, and North Africa
**"Chapter 8: New World Islam"**
- Columbus' belief he found a western route to Asia - inability to fir the New World into his understanding of the globe
- vocabulary of war with Islam as language of Spanish conquest in Americas - old world filtering
	- Cortes also as a veteran of the Reconquista 
	- paranoid imagination
**"Chapter 9: Christian Jihad"**
- "The Requirement" as a claim over the land and peoples of the New World - Islamic features of an anti-Islamic mission
	- recited to native peoples with no understanding of the performance
	- only European state to have done so - mocked as a recognition and concession to Islam (historigraphy)
**"Chapter 10: The Taino-Muslims of Hispaniola"**
- slavery as the entrance of Islam to the New World
	- European slavery versus Islamic slavery
	- West African Muslim populations - Wolof
- gold mining in Hispaniola - sugar farming
	- common enemy between African Muslims and Taino Natives
	- first rebellion against slavery in the West
- ==continuation of Christian - Muslim conflict==
- ==binding together of the Old and New world by perpetuating the existing violence on a new group of people across new lands==

**Fleicher, Kafadar, and Subrahmanyam - "How to Write Fake Global History"** [[9.17 Fleischer.pdf]]
- critique of Mikhail - errors of fact and logic, serious misinterpretations, and Mikhail himself as not equipped to write such history (environmental historian on 18th century Egypt)
	- sources not easily identified or verified - avoiding process of normal peer-review
- not necessarily against the central argument that Islam is central to understanding the West and it's complex interactions between Muslims and non-Muslims - rather the making of the history itself
- "great man" history - stretch facts, distort the laws of time and space, and sometimes resort to outright falsehoods (4)
	- question of Selim's territories, fleets, and ports
	- Muslim majority in the empire - rejection of Selim's authority - invention of letters
	- state violence by Selim - lack of focus toward Protestantism
	- false claim of coffee

**Gabriele and Perry - *The Bright Ages: A New History of Medieval Europe*** [[9.17 G & P.pdf]]
**"Introduction: The Bright Ages"**
- shifting perspective on the Middle Ages
	- Ravenna church mosaics - Dante
	- use of medieval for current problems - simplification of glorious artifacts for purity and legitimizing current white supremacists
- politics of the medieval past invoking the image of "dark ages"
**"Epilogue: The Dark Ages"**
- debate about medieval vs modern / religion vs secularism
- inability to separate Renaissance horrors from medieval practices and art from inequality/slavery
	- enslaved people sold alongside the spices, texts, and cultural exchanges - not an isolated story
- construction of a usable past to create western identity

**Schuessler - "Medieval Scholars Spar on a Modern Battlefield: Twitter"** [[9.17 Medieval.pdf]]

# **9.24**
**Cohn - "Epidemiology of the Black Death and Successive Waves of Plague" [[9.24 - Cohn.pdf]]
- complications over if each of the pandemics of the bubonic plague were actually the same disease
	- argues that there are too many discrepancies for it to have been Yersina pestis in each instance

**DeWitte and Wood - "Selectivity of Black Death Morality with Respect to Preexisting Health" [[9.24 - DeWitte Wood.pdf]]
- disclaimer about the cemeteries associated with Black Death not being expected to provide a good cross-section should have been at the beginning
	- I don't see this as very convincing

**Benedictow - "The Black Death: The Greatest Catastrophe Ever" [[9.24 - The Black Death: The Greatest Catastrophe Ever | History Today.pdf]]**
-  connection of spread to the economic and social changes of the day 
	- faster shipping of larger quantities of livestock, supplies, crops, etc. - movement between otherwise isolated areas where the plague was more likely to have taken due to the rats/fleas (faster than travel by land)
- change in data due to new understandings of 'normal' mortality to then compare with plague mortality

**Bos, et al - "A Draft Genome of Yersina pestis from Victims of the Black Death" [[9.24 - Bos.pdf]]
- maintains that the strain has not adapted to have the same virulity as during the plague - need to consider other factors that made the plague so disasterous

**Royer - "The Blind Men and the Elephant: Imperial Medicine, Medieval Historians, and the Role of Rats in the Historiography of the Plague" [[9.24 - Royer.pdf]]
- rats as an over-simplification of the means of spread
- privileging of voices over those in India with first hand accounts
	- Plague Research Commission - historians overlooking conditions research was done in - not scientific people
- desire for a one size fits all explanation to a very complicated and regional experience

**Seifert, et al - "Genotyping Yersinia pestis in Historical Plague: Evidence for Long-Term Persistence of Y. pestis in Europe from the 14th to the 17th Century" [[9.24 - Seifert.pdf]]
- long distances between studies - geographically and time wise
	- difficulty gleaning evidence without doubt

**Dean, et al - "Human ectoparasites and the spread of plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic" [[9.24 - Dean.pdf]]
- most recent article - argument for human lice/vectors over rats

# **10.22**
**Eltis, Morgan, and Richardson - "Agency and Diaspora in Atlantic History"** [[10.22 - Eltis 1.pdf]]
- main argument that despite Carney's expansion on Wood and Littlefield being an important example of moving beyond the binary of folkways vs environments, it is too narrow in scope and too broad in suggested impact - problematizing the evidence of the indigenous knowledge system of rice being a factor in preferences of planters, labor organization, and gender proportions of enslaved populations
	- use of sugar plantations as having more influence in setting the reality of plantation labor within the Americas and demands transferred back to Africa in turn - Atlantic influence - reflection of larger merchant-capitalistic impulses

**AHR Questions** [[10.22 - AHR Questions.pdf]]
- specific critique notes within
- response lackluster - ignorance of the larger issue of engaging with cultural exchanges where one group is relegated to a subordinate position - necessity of correcting that imbalance in all facets in order to correct - unable to "meet in middle"
	**Edelson - "Beyond 'Black Rice'"** [[10.22 - Edelson.pdf]]
	- critique of Eltis, Morgan, and Richardson for being heavy handed in their critique of Carney - specifically in regards to their methodology of using statistics to refute broader, more interpretive claims about cultural exchange
		- reflection of the gaps in the archives - paramount in consideration of cultural history and voices that have been suppressed
	- Support of the "black rice" thesis more broadly but fairly critical of Carney's focus on the risculture and African exchange without including the influence of violence within the American slavery system
	**Hall - "Africa and Africans in the African Diaspora"** [[10.22 - Hall.pdf]]
	- critique of Eltis, Morgan, and Richardson for misusing TSTD2 data to make too broad of claims
		- reflection of a larger debate over the authority given to "hard science" as databases - which Hall reflects as extremly helpful and exciting development - become more useful in historical research and the caution required to examine what is missing and how large its scope is able to reach without the priviledge of looking individually at the sources it contains (what is omitted? why? etc.)
	- overarching critique of the lack of credibility given to the culture and knowledge brought into the Atlantic world by the africans and generalization that reduces them again
	**Hawthorne - "From 'Black Rice' to 'Brown'" [[10.22 - Hawthorne.pdf]]
	- critique of Eltis, Morgan, and Richardson for being too broad reaching in their claims - almost to the point of trying to undermine the black rice thesis as a whole, and not giving Carney's argument the nuance it deserves/puts forth
		- ICW Edelson - critical of his argument that Europeans brought process of water channneling as outside of the geographic scope of the Low Country
		- ICW Hall - similar reflection over debate about archival sources vs geographic/cultural sources

**Eltis, Morgan, and Richardson - "Black, Brown, or White?"** [[10.22 - Eltis 2.pdf]] 
- response to the AHR Questions/critiques - certainly more responsive to Hawthorne who sat in the middle and most defensive against Hall who closest aligns with Carney
- restates arguments and claims that it wanted to make the Atlantic label most pronounced - I would argue it is still a (potentially unintentional) erasure of the African cultural influence

# **10.29**
**Klein - Frontiers of Historical Imagination** [[10.29 - Klein.pdf]]
- reflection of narrativism debate - proximity to verifiable science/empirical data
	- how does history relate to the human understanding of the human world
- public memory and historical imagination
	- suspicion of historical authority over knowledge
- Turnerian theories - complexity and originality of his approach - creation of historical engagment

**Slotkin - Gunfighter Nation** [[10.29 - Slotkin.pdf]]
- reliance on myths as reflections of historical memory - necessary to understand and rework in order to break the cycle
	- specific connections to popular culture as a vehicle for continuation of the myth

**White**
- inability to separate the created memory and cultural nostalgia that has become separate (though originated by) the historical idea - pessimistic that this would be possible for a long time to come

**Limerick - The Legacy of Conquest** [[10.29 - Limerick.pdf]]
- decoupling from the capitalist and political impositions on the land under the American system - more adjacent to the native system pre-existing, focused on the land as its own entity at the center of the narrative
	- desire to create a regional synthesis between minority-led journalistic success and American historical narritive of the west - specifically 1980s as pivotal

# **11.12**
**Hutton** - [[11.12 - Hutton.pdf]]
- changing media representation not strictly following the changes within historiography 
- frontier as stubborn desert or glorious refuge - never aligning with the reality of its "ownership" under Native American tribes

**Elliot** - [[11.12 - Elliott.pdf]]
- presentist approach
- political over racial/cultural
- really trying to make his approach stand out as different - historiography and ethnograpy, public history, literarcy criticism, etc.
- elastic symbolic power of defeat
- monuments as a place of historical tension between United States and Native Tribes and unresolved questions as well as tension over the future

**Marshall** - [[11.12 - Marshall.pdf]]

		- written in german and then english - considered abridged but still good resource for students withoug german language skills
		- critique against the consistency and continuity that Fischer insists on
		- question of available documentation
		- American access to German archives
			- question of harshness - what other countries have had their archives and complete aims aired for all to study

**Blackbourn** - [[11.19 - Blackbourn.pdf]]
	- question of the "Normalising" of WWII history?

**Goldhagen - *Hitler's Willing Executioners*** - [[11.19 - Goldhagen.pdf]]
	- importance of considering perpetrators at the center of the genocide, influenced by political and military impulses/impressions
		- problematizing general considerations (or lack of considerations) of individual human will
	- complications of antisemitism - drawing the line from rhetoric and belief into action

**Browning - *Ordinary Men*** - [[11.19 - Browning.pdf]]
	- opposing view of Goldhagen
		- response to critiques by Goldhagen in afterword - emphasis on wide acclaim and desire for Goldhagen's view to be right but not seeing it as realistic in the world we live in
