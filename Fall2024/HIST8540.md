**Brown - Dispatches from Dystopia: Histories of Places Not Yet Forgotten** [[8.28 - Brown.pdf]]
CH 1 - Being There
- "How does a story mature when I acknowledge that my view is obstructed, my perspective land-bound and limited?"
- "Do I write a history as if the answers were just something to be found, dusted off, and written up, rather than admit that my history entails a selection of some places, objects, and sources over others, which are then pondered over, pasted together, and intuited by no one other than me?"
- ==Taking seriously the lived experiences and histories of those within a space, as well as the space itself, as a scholarly source - accepting that this requires inserting oneself and creating a narrative aside from the norm of objectivity in research==
CH 3 - History (Im)possible in the Chernobyl Zone
- misrepresentations and appropriations of an "unchanging traveler" narrative mode
- Pripyat - connection to idealized Cold War American suburbs
- "The very orderly modernity of Pripyat composed a confident, soothing spatial narrative that lulled to sleep healthy fears of nuclear catastrophe. Perhaps for this reason, few people noticed before the accident that the Chernobyl plant was poorly managed and leaking radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment."
- when observing sources, how do we decipher the truth? are there any "true" sources left if everything has already been impacted by researchers and constituents (?) of the past
- ==Chernobyl and Pripyat as actors contradictory in some ways to the history portrayed globally about a nuclear wasteland - image of modernity and prosperity among the remnants of a catastrophe that was in part caused by neglect and inattention==

**Ethington - Placing the Past: 'Groundwork' for a spatial theory of history** [[8.28 - Ethington.pdf]]
- ==argues for the inseparability of the past and the place it is set in - human action makes the places - history is the map of all the places==\
	- maps representing relationships among topoi
- change over space rather than change over time - knowledge of the past therefore being cartographic
	- representation of the past - ==topoi==, topos - place, denote specific places of the past
- spatial turn - late 1980s
- remapping the past of knowing - pragmatic-hermeneutic tradition (contexts and interpretations) - temporality and historicity (relating to time and historical authenticity)
	- argues for he reconstruction of pragmatic tradition to add the spacial turn 
		- ==critique of metaphoric spatiality as a weak foundation to build a history== - spatiality needed to give more validity
- 'what is time' - historiography to show relation between status of time that changes their works rather than refutes them
	- chronology vs time
- time cannot be absolute  - 'spacetime' rather than going back in time
	- *relating this to memory and its centrality in history - unsure what he is arguing* 
- lived experience of time - necessity of historical critique between measured time and spatial time
- metaphors to highlight intersections of language and experience - using it for time in a literal sense of physical presence? 
- Georg Simmel - theorizing integrality of spatiality - linking metaphoric with non-metaphoric - ignored by historiography
	- ==intersubjective social interaction== 'closeness' and 'remoteness' vs 'close by' and 'near' w/ 'remote' - intersection and boundaries
- goals: strengthen postpositivist work (believe realilty can only be known imperfectly) in the pragmatic tradition; method of placing the past being called neo-foundational as a historical institution

**Farmer - This Was the Place: The Making and Unmaking of Utah** [[8.28 - Farmer.pdf]]
- place creation and landscape loss - unsettling of mental geography/inner compass - geographic impermanence
	- haunting of landscapes
- metageography - large-scale geographic concepts (ex: continents)
	- informs geopolitical landscape ("third world" or "the Middle East" or "the West")
- regional identification - mountains vs hydrological
- commercial discovery of tourist attraction sites - automobile age
- sacred space and land ethic
- Deseret - Utah - 1850s
	- confliction with American national identity
	- Salt Lake Meridian at Temple Square

**Jackson - By Way of Conclusion: How to Study the Landscape** [[8.28 - Jackson.pdf]]
- state facts - provide examples - draw conclusions
- landscapes gradually take form when people move into a place, survive and prosper w/ resources at hand, and organize into a group for mutual help/protection and celebration - they grow and change and have a chronology
- ==the American grid system as one of the most ambitious schemes in history for the orderly creation of landscapes and small communities==
- dwellings as a key to understand the rest of the landscape - defined in therms of its longevity, relation to work, family and the community and natural environment
- tradition to the contemporary American landscape with industrialization and changes of the farm/land 
	- federal land
	- roads/travel post railroad
	- destruction of the American grid system
- spatial division - permanent social distinctions and autonomous work/home/society
	- disposal rather than storage
	- high demand and usage of energy rather than conservation 

**Withers - Place and the 'Spatial Turn' in Geography and in History** [[8.28 - Withers.pdf]]
- 2009
- historiographical survey of "place" within recent work in geography - tracing connections between place, space, and localness 
	- spatial turn 
	- focus on Casey ('97)
- ==place and space has been as central to historians as other academics just differently expressed - and there is a value in looking at the different expressions to understand that the definition of place is not agreed upon, indecision which has perks and downfalls - spatial turn is a process in accounting for uneven movement of ideas across space and time and can strengthen the line between geography and history==
	- place as locality to help provide framework for inquiry
- problematic definitions of place - a central idea to geography and history - affecting other studies (interdisciplinary approach)
	- Agnew ('87) - place is attachment - humanistic study of place as an idea/way of being
	- Tuan ('74) - place about stopping, resting. etc. becoming involved in space
	- Casey ('93) - place via emotional responses inherent
	- place as a social practice - considered also by 'authenticity'
		- tourism/commodification
	- attention to place reflected within history and other studies
- argues that social sciences/natural sciences are depending on place in terms of location - but history reveals the impermanence of places over time
	- place making - capacity to include local histories and geographies to find place identity
- *mobility of science?*
- the Enlightenment - local manifestations vs nation scale
	- renewed attention to place and connections between places to displace assumptions about core locations and meanings

# **9.4**
**White - What is Spatial History** [[9.4 White.pdf]]
- operating outside normal historical practice
	- collaborative 
	- visualizations
	- dependence on digital history
	- open ended - *are normal works of history not?*
	- conceptual focus on space
- Henri Lefebvre - "space is neither simply natural geography nor an empty container filled by history. [...] Space is itself historical." (2)
- =="Spatial representation is an attempt to conceive in order to shape what is lived and perceived."== (2)
- representational space - lived and experienced through symbolic associations (3)
- movement as the key of spatial experience
	- ==We produce and reproduce space through our movements and the movements of goods that we ship and information that we exchange== (3)

**Knowles - *Placing History: How Maps, Spatial Data, and GIS Are Changing Historical Scholarship,* "GIS and History"*** [[9.4 Knowles.pdf]]
- GIS changing the practice of history
- argues historians don't generally regard images as sources of historical evidence (2) - disagree
- "Despite its diversity, historical GIS is animated by a common interest in situating history in its geographical context and using geographic information to illuminate the past." (3)
- *Annales* approach - metaphorical mapping
- Paul Carter again - umbrella term for scholarship that examines human experience of social and physical space
- ==In conversation with White==
	- ==visual and digital history - reflects "author's desire not to assert the authority of written history, whose aim has traditionally been to argue for particular interpretations of events" rather encourage engagements== (5)
- historical GIS - historical inquiry driven by geographical question, evidence provided by geographical information, evidence structured and analyzed via database recording both location and time (7)
- "Whether one works with texts, historical maps, or any other kind of source, cultivating a spatial and visual imagination makes it easier to recognize the place-based information and spatial relationships embedded in historical evidence." (18)

**Bodenhamer - *Placing History: How Maps, Spatial Data, and GIS Are Changing Historical Scholarship*, "History and GIS: Implications for the Discipline"** [[9.4 Bodenhamer.pdf]]
- "If GIS is ever to become central to historical scholarship, it must do so within the norms embraced by historians and from a sophisticated understanding of the philosophy of history and not simply its methods." (220)
- "historians seek to portray a world that is lost, not to re-create it precisely" (222)
	- abstractionism 
- obstacles to GIS becoming more common/development of historical GIS
- "In sum, historical GIS offers an alternate view of history through the dynamic representation of time and place within culture." (231)
	- argues that it should be as routine as traditional interpretive narratives and research methods

**Gregory & Geddes - *Toward Spatial Humanities: Historical GIS & Spatial History,* "Introduction: From Historical GIS to Spatial Humanities: Deepening Scholarship and Broadening Technology"** [[9.4 Gregory Geddes.pdf]]
- positivist - any system that confines itself to the data of experience and excludes a priori or metaphysical speculations
- HGIS deepening from an applied perspective - researchers applying it to scholarship that develops new knowledge about the past - and broadening from a technical perspective - widening potential to include qualitative and quantitative sources
	- "This means that GIS is thus able to expand beyond social science history - a fairly narrow field - to be applicable to the discipline more broadly, and beyond that to spread outside the disciplinary boundaries of history into other humanities disciplines." (x)
- up to the researcher to make the data have a larger meaning and avoid drastic generalizations - positivism
- maps don't answer questions, they pose them

# **9.11**
**Monmonier - *How to Lie with Maps* **[[9.11 Monmonier.pdf]]
**"Chapter 1: Introduction"**
- argues that maps inherently lie because they have to distort reality - need for healthy skepticism and promotion of understanding and appreciation "of their flexibility as a medium of communication" (1-3)
- "a single map is but one of an indefinitely large number of maps that might be produced for the same situation or from the same data" (2)
**"Chapter 2: Elements of the Map"
- elements of distortion - scale, projection, and symbolization
	- scale - expressed as a ratio, short sentence, or simple graph
		- "small-scale maps have a smaller capacity for truth than large-scale maps" (6-7)
	- projections - transforming curved 3D onto a flat 2D place
		- lists different types/patterns of projections
		- "No flat map can match the globe in preserving areas, angles, gross shapes, distances, and directions, and any map projection is a compromise solution." (13)
	- symbols - complements scale and projection to show features, places, and other information on the map
		- suppresses information deemed unimportant - *by who?*
**"Chapter 3: Map Generalization: Little White Lies and Lots of Them"**
- "Clarity demands geometric generalization because map symbols usually occupy proportionately more space on the map than the features they represent occupy on the ground." (25)
- point features and map labels
- Content generaliztion - selection and classification
	- "Selection, which serves geometric generalization by suppressing some information, promotes content generalization by choosing only relevant features." (25)
	- "Classification, in contrast, makes the map helpfully informative as well as usable by recognizing similarities among the features chosen so that a single type of symbol can represent a group of similar features." (35)

- "If we as digital humanists are serious about our commitment to social justice - especially our field's investment in these surveillance technologies and the ways in which they make us and our collaborators vulnerable to undue monitoring and weaponization."
	- weaponization to underscore exacerbation of violence
	- creation of tools that rely on third-party software systems and use other surveillance technologies in research and pedagogy
- "operationalizing" surveillance studies - develop ethical solutions
- GIS and military use
- EdTech surveillance

**Harris, Corrigan, and Bodenhamer - "Challenges for the Spatial Humanities: Toward a Research Agenda"** [Link](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/clemson/reader.action?docID=1402899&ppg=186)
- GIS as a core component of the spatial turn - new insight in humanities scholarship
	- identify the present status, history, and nature of the challenges facing the spatial humanities and critically explore the theories, concepts, and methodologies in GIS usage (167)
- "over-reliance on technique and method" (168)
- 6 themes that mark the field of spatial humanities
	- Latent tension - linking a positivist technology with predominantly humanist traditions
	- epistemological and ontological implications - "GIS is embedded in a positivist epistemology premised on an objective reality that can be discovered through a process of observation, testing, and the application of the scientific method" (170)
	- seductive technology w/ reductionist allure and wondrous images - maps as a powerful medium (Bodenhamer all over it) but also deceptive
	- more methods and approaches outside of off-the-shelf software packages - geovisualization, Geospatial Web
	- centrality of time - change occurring simultaneously through time and space, should not separate or prioritize one over the other - "sptio-temporal GIS to explore changes in space through time" (173)
	- aspects of places as equally if not more important to the humanities than the GIS focus on space and spatial analysis - "place making" and cultural practices, technology unable to recreate that
		- deep mapping - *PrairyErth (a deep map* by William Least Heat-Moon)

**Mattern - "Gaps in the Map: Why We're Mapping Everything, and Why Not Everything Can, or Should, be Mapped"** [Link](https://wordsinspace.net/2015/09/18/gaps-in-the-map-why-were-mapping-everything-and-why-not-everything-can-or-should-be-mapped/)
- maps as a means of representing the territory on which we live to ourselves - and see where we lie within that territory
- "Maps are a foundational part of the wired world's social, cultural, and political terrain; and they're of tremendous political-economic importance to the non-wired portions of the world that cartographers often depict (often for 'development' purposes)."
	- Maps as media - cultural form
		- material artifacts/interfaces "that adhere to the particular protocols of communication"
		- "produced by myriad entities [...] for various reasons, and subject to both cartographic conventions and variable aesthetic or editorial choices"
		- "distributed among myriad 'users' in particular ways; and they're accessed, 'processed', and interpreted by those users in different ways"

# **9.18**
**Kemp - "Geographic Information Science and Spatial Analysis for the Humanities"** [[9.18 Kemp.pdf]]
- conceptual foundation and synergistic tools to explore the humanities as they intersect with geography
	- integration of seemingly unrelated events
- contrasting definitions of scale - clarification required
- objects and fuzzy set theory
	- use of the word scale again - ==confusing==
- categories and ontologies - consider ones audience
- relative location - locations relative to the location of other places
- absolute location - locations anchored to the earth via a coordinate system so that interactions in geographic space can be explored 

**Schwartz & Thevenin - "Railways and Agriculture in France and Great Britain, 1850-1914"** [[9.18 Schwartz Thevenin.pdf]]
- road trains to support rural populations and farming economies (sounds like a bus to me)
- French access to transportation
- change over space and time between rail transport and agricultural production - Jeffries' identifying the crisis but not seeing the correlation (5-6)
- "In this case, encoding the geographic coordinates in each unit of analysis makes it possible to ==calculate many different aspects of distance, proximity, accessibility, and transport cost when joined with GIS data== on the development and railways and rail stations from the 1830s and 1930s. Using georeferenced information on agricultural production and land use attached to British counties, registration districts, and parishes and to the corresponding units of French administration - departments, cantons, and communes - gives us ==comparable data at these several scales of geographic resolution==." (8)
	- ability to explore new questions about proximity and access for rural communities and agricultural development
- Britain - accessibility in sparsley populated regions, inconveniences reduced by Great War
	- proximity, station facilities, prices, timing, and connections
- France - faster expansion, 2/3 rural areas within half days walk to a train
- ==Dorset - 62% of the variation can be accounted for by rail accessibility and mean elevation (18-19)==
	- short and long term decisions by farmers able to be seen on a larger scale - reflection of a larger issue/change
- Cote-d'Or - railway accessibility influenced changes but a decade later than Dorset, inverse relation (further from rail, farmers more likely to use land for more profitable purpose)
	- ==reflection of national trend and dependency on rail transport infrastructure for shifting market conditions==

**MacDonald & Black - "Using GIS for Spatial and Temporal Analyses in Print Culture Studies: Some Opportunities and Challenges"** [[9.18 MacDonald Black.pdf]]

- firm level - trust in human coalition?
- 584 - "controllable description" - recall conversation on place and space and "truth"
- labor intensive and source/storage intensive - justified by providing and answering historical questions

**Geography of the Post** [Link](https://cameronblevins.org/gotp/)
- late 1800s - 1900s - on duration view it appears most are longer duration but then on status view it is lit up across the board orange
	- seems contradictory but I wonder if this was maybe the closures of older less "standard" post offices that were replaced by federally appointed ones? (totally random guess)

**Invasion of America** [Link](https://usg.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=eb6ca76e008543a89349ff2517db47e6)
- is it an oversimplification to show it based off treaties/executive orders when, in reality, it was also an ongoing slow loss of land and conflict between generations?

# **Lab Lecture: Data Display and Cartography**
next week - bring drawing tools and a ruler
- turn in hard copy by October 1st - or scan and send to Hsu
**Cartographic Principles**
- cartography - discipline concerned with the conception, production, dissemination, and study of maps in all forms
- map elements - title; body; legend; north arrow; scale; acknowledgement; neatline/map border
	- map scale = map distance/real world distance 
		- size on paper - use google map for real world size
		- scale on the map is 0 - 1 unit - 2 units (CM - M)
- map abstraction - process of moving from the "real world" to the world of maps - making choices about how to represent features
- map content and generation
	- point - line - polygon
	- map legend - description of key points on a map
	- map generalization - process of simplifying real world features for representation on a map
- cartographic symbolization
	- raster data - applies to cells
	- vector data - depends on the feature type (point, line, polygon)
	- spacing - density; size - value; shape - categorical data; lightness - value
	- volumetric data - isolines / isarithmic map
	- aggregate data 
	- visual variables - hue, value, saturation (color); size and texture (quantitative); shape and pattern (qualitative)
		- quantitative
			- diverging or double-ended scheme - using graduated colors between two dominant colors
			- part spectral or full spectral scheme - distinction versus continuity
	- data classification
		- choropleth maps - graded differences in color to define average values of some property or quantity (equal interval, geometric interval, equal frequency/quantile, mean and standard deviation, natural breaks, user defined/manual)
		- bivariate map - quantitative data combined with qualitative data and simplified into categories
		- generalization - used to overcome challenges and improve symbolization
	- types of map
		- reference map - general purpose
		- thematic map - specific topic or theme
	- map symbol - dot map, graduated symbol map, choropleth map, chart map, flow map
- following general principles makes the map most effective for your reader and less likely to be misleading

Geospatial Big Data and Its Applications: Challenges and Opportunities
- GIS as a toolbox - information system - method to science - industry - contribution to society
- 6 Vs of Geospatial big data - Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity, Visualization, Visibility
- Focus on remote sensing, text/social media, and location/GPS
Remote Sensing
- LCLUC - Land cover and land use change
	- impacts of clouds - contamination of data
		- cloud shadow detection - comparison over years
	- impacts of seasonality - difficulty comparing leaf-on vs leaf-off seasons
	- How often should we select the images for LCLUC?
	- Complicated human activities
	- Volume, Velocity, Visualization - improving mapping accuracy of subpixel urban land cover using a larger archive 
	- Drone usage - creation of new images that are more controllable
		- restrictions of height - stitching images together
	- Deepfake satellite images - base map fitted with satellite imagery and other base maps to simulate new maps
Textual Big Data - Human as Sensors
- Geotagged tweets on campus vs electric consumption
	- patterns of dormitories
	- Volume, Velocity, Visualization

- Methane monitoring

# **10.2**
**Cunfer - "Scaling the Dust Bowl"**[[10.9 - Cunfer.pdf]]
- creation of a historical place via the actors within it that are seen to have caused a catastrophic event - lacking the temporal and spatial context that is available now due to our ability to zoom out/look back
	- ICW - Donahue - not perceiving the land itself as an actor within the narrative - historical and place memory built out of what we've been told by sources, documentation and "mass marketing" (102) 
- not that the farmers didn't know causes and trends within their landscape (ie - drier conditions from lack of rainfall contributing to land erosion) - but historical memory places the blame on Great Plains farmers for not implementing a sustainable agricultural system (such as the mixed husbandry in Concord) to combat the capitalist impulses (even though Concord still succumbed after a certain point)
	- Capitalism is not ecologically sustainable in any light
- ==what is told about a space is to create a place that is beneficial to their aims==
	- newspapers of new towns wanted to entice settlers - downplay issues like drought, dust storms, etc.
	- larger federal government wanted to give political justification for expansion of agencies and reform - exploit as an example of why it is necessary
- moving between these two extremes makes the audience - who may have a limited or new conception of the place - see them coming out of nowhere as a result of new developments, rather than a result of things happening prior to their conception of the place

**Sutter - "The World with Us: The State of American Enironmental History"** [[10.9 - Sutter.pdf]]
- hybridity within the historiography of environmental history - allowing for a relationship between nature and the human interactions with it rather than isolating nature as a static neutral 
	- allowing for a more complex conversation about causation and effect within historical narratives imparted in a place - ICW - Cunfer/Dust Bowl
- problematizing of agency - line between human and non human factors

# **10.30**
**Knowles - Mastering Iron**
- Introduction:
	- comparison of historiography of iron in Britain vs America
		- iron as last major industry to be mechanized - all male, focus on skilled immigrant labor - control over production - late development of unions
	- spatial focus - centrality of the geography to the iron industry - quality of resources and cost of transportation
		- importance of international influence - adaptation of British methods not compatible with geography
	- iron central to devices that facilitated American expansion, transportation, and manufacturing - included in too many things to facilitate one specific icon
	- p.5 - "Why did it take most of the nineteenth century for the United States to match the British iron industry's scale of production?"
		- fill gap in industrialization history
		- explain disparities between companies who successfully/unsuccessfully employed British tactics and those that didn't
		- mapping data to see different technologies used at antebellum ironworks
			- empirical not theoretical approach
		- hybridity of American ironworking
	- p. 6 - places at each end of technological transfer
	- prominence of Welsh immigrants
	- p. 8 - chapter overview
- Conclusion
	- north/south divisions present in the iron industry post Civil War
	- regional movement of the industry - measures of success
		- quality and techniques of Welsh ironworking
	- p. 234 - no one model of American ironworking - rather based off number of characteristics with varying degrees of proximity to British
		- diversity of demand and requirements by expansion - diversity of workforce
		- more spatially dispersed than British - necessitated by deposits locations
		- importance of human connections for modernizing
		- emphasis on adequate quality (middle of small amount of great - big amount of meh)
		- success based off manager emphasis on skills and knowledge in their workers
		- varied landscapes shaping industry's development - influencing the community's development
